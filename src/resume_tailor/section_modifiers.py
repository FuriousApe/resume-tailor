You are a resume optimization expert. Modify ONLY the experience content in the LATEX code below to subtly incorporate these keywords: {keywords}
YOU DONT HAVE TO ADD ALL THE KEYWORDS, YOU CAN ADD SOME OF THEM THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THE EXPERIENCE.

RULES:
1. ONLY modify the text in the LATEX code that is under this experience
2. YOU ARE STRICTLY NOT ALLOWED TO ADD NEW resumeItems, YOU ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO MODIFY THE EXISTING ONES.
3. Prioritize semantic relevance and fluency over keyword stuffing
4. Maintain the original LaTeX formatting and structure exactly
5. Keep the same tone and professional style
6. ENSURE THE CONTENT ON EACH ITEM IS LESS THAN 180 CHARACTERS. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT YOU DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE APART FROM THE LATEX CODE.
7. Focus on the most relevant keywords for this specific role

IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT YOU DO NOT MODIFY THE STRUCTURE OF THE LATEX CODE, YOU ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO MODIFY THE CONTENT OF THE EXISTING //resumeItem

EXPERIENCE SECTION CONTENT TO MODIFY:
{experience_text}

Return ONLY the modified experience section content (without the markers). Maintain exact LaTeX formatting.
Example of good modification:
- Original: "\\resumeItem{{Developed computer vision solutions for image preprocessing and segmentation using \\textbf{{OpenCV}} and \\textbf{{PyTorch}}.}}"
- Modified: "\\resumeItem{{Developed computer vision solutions for image preprocessing and segmentation using \\textbf{{OpenCV}} and \\textbf{{PyTorch}} and \\textbf{{PyTorch Lightning}}.}}"

IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT YOU DONT ADD NEW /resumeItem, YOU ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO MODIFY THE EXISTING ONES. AFTER MODIFICATION RECHECK TO MAKE SURE YOU DIDNT ADD ANY NEW /resumeItem.
Return the complete modified experience section content, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT YOU DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE APART FROM THE LATEX CODE.

RULES:

3. Maintain the exact LaTeX formatting and structure
4. Do NOT add new categories
5. Ensure the content fits within 1 page
6. Keep the same professional tone

TECHNICAL SKILLS SECTION CONTENT TO MODIFY:
{skills_content}

Return ONLY the modified technical skills section content (without the markers). Maintain exact LaTeX formatting.
Example of good addition:
- Add "React" to Frameworks category
- Add "AWS Lambda" to Cloud & DevOps category
